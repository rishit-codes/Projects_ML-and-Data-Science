# 📊 Machine Learning & Data Science Projects

Welcome to my repository where I document my learning journey in **Machine Learning** and **Data Science** through hands-on projects, experiments, and notebooks.

Each folder in this repository represents a project or module where I explore different algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and model evaluation strategies. I aim to apply theoretical concepts to practical use cases using real-world datasets.

## 📁 What's Inside

- ### `LINEAR_REGRESSION/`
  A complete project analyzing teen phone addiction using linear regression models. Includes:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature correlation analysis
  - Multiple regression models: Linear, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet
  - Model comparison and evaluation
  - Cleaned datasets and saved models

*(More project folders will be added as I progress)*
