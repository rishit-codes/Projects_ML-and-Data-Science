# 📊 Machine Learning & Data Science Projects

Welcome to my repository where I document my hands-on learning journey in **Machine Learning** and **Data Science** through real-world datasets and end-to-end projects.

Each folder represents a self-contained project where I explore algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, model evaluation strategies, and best practices.
