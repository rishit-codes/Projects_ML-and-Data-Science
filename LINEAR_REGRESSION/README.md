# Teen Phone Addiction Analysis
This project explores the impact of smartphone usage on teenagers' lifestyle and mental health using the Teen Phone Addiction dataset. It applies machine learning models like Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet to predict addiction levels and understand influencing factors.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Distribution plots for all numeric columns
- Correlation heatmap
- Pair plots for selected features
- Box plots to compare usage patterns vs addiction levels

## Models Used
- Linear Regression (Baseline)
- Ridge Regression (with cross-validation)
- Lasso Regression (with alpha tuning)
- ElasticNet (best performance)

All models were evaluated using:
- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error

## Acknowledgements

- Kaggle for the dataset
- Scikit-learn for ML models
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualizations
